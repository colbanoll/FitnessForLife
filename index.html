      <p class="left">On the left you can see a young adult with no purpose no plan just living among any other human on the planet. I was depressed, I was scared of how my future would look, I was tired of working a 9-5 job giving me anxiety for no real reason, I just felt powerless about myself.</p>
    
      <p class="right">On the right is the same person just 6 weeks apart. I applied for an University, I started adopting new healthy habits I never imagined before. I stopped taking depression medication and having therapy sessions. I started spending my money responsably and changed my whole way of thinking and approach towards life. I never ever felt the same kind of anxiety I was feeling prior to my old way of life and never will ever again. Feel free to take any membership suits you and find more about my journey and what your journey will look like.</p>
